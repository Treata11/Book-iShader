/**
 A shader that generates a uniform wave effect.
 
 This works by offsetting the Y position of each pixel by some amount of its X
 position. Using sin() for this generates values between -1 and 1, but this then
 gets multiplied by 10 to increase the strength.
 
 - Parameter position: The user-space coordinate of the current pixel.
 - Parameter time: The number of elapsed seconds since the shader was created
 - Parameter speed: How fast to make the waves ripple. Try starting with a value of 5.
 - Parameter smoothing: How much to smooth out the ripples, where greater values
   produce a smoother effect. Try starting with a value of 20.
 - Parameter strength: How pronounced to make the ripple effect. Try starting with a
 value of 5.
 - Returns: The new pixel color.
